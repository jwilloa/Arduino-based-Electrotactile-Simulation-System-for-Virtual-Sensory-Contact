# Project Title - Arduino-based Electrotactile Simulation System for Virtual Sensory Contact

The project has been tweaked a little bit from it's orginal assignment. Elaborating on the project title, a glove will be worn by a user, and mapping of the finger movements will determine whether contact with a virtual object has been made.
Upon contact, the user will experience electrotactile stimulation on their fingertips, sufficient enough to give the impression of touch.
